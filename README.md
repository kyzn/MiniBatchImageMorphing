#Image Morphing for Mini Batches in DNN

![An example for morphing: each row is a different digit.](https://github.com/kyzn/MiniBatchImageMorphing/raw/master/Example.png)

As part of UCSC - CS218 "Deep Learning" class, we wanted to work on possible ways to improve our test accuracy. One idea was to introduce more images to mini-batches. We did it by creating new images. 

This code is based on [https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning/blob/master/README.md](Michael Nielsen's code), which uses MNIST dataset. We also used the same data.
